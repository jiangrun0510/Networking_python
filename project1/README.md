## Project 1 of Computer Networking

### Object: You will build a simple web client and a web server to which it can connect.

### Part 1: a simple curl clone
You will implement a simple command-line HTTP client, implemented using the BSD socket interface.  You must use Python's "socket" package and no other (higher-level) network library.

### Part 2: a simple web server
Write an HTTP server that handles one connection at a time and that serves any files in the current directory if their name ends with  .html or .htm. 

### Part 3: multi-connection web server
Write an HTTP server, http_server2, that avoids two of these situations: (1) waiting for a connection to be established, and (2) waiting on the read after a connection has been established.
